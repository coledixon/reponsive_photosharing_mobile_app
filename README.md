# Foundations-CSS-with-Handlebars
Side navigation and modals for a photo-sharing app project.

This was a Live project I worked on for Tech Academy in Portland, OR.
My team and I were tasked with designing a photo-sharing app for a client.
We worked via MEAN stack utilizing Node.js, Foudations CSS, and Handlebars.
My projects were to create a responsive side-navigation bar, a 'view galleries' page, and an 'edit galleries' page.
I implemented these additional pages as modals within my side navigation bar to add functionality to the app.
